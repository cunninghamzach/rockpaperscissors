## The Assignment Rubric:
1. Your task is to write a program that will play 5 games of rock, paper, scissors with a user, keeping track of the score and printing the final score at the end (winner gets 3 out of 5)

2. The game shall ask the player's name at the very beginning, which will be used in the printing of the final scores (or for taunting the player between rounds if you want to add that)

3. For each round, the computer shall choose one of the values (rock paper scissors), asks the user for their value, and prints both as well a who won that round or if there is a tie.

4. After 5 games, the program shall print the total score in the format shown below:
  <Player'sName>:  2 wins, 1 loss, 2 draw
  Computer:  1 win, 2 loss, 2 draw
  Congrats <Player'sName>, you Win!
5. If the computer wins, it shall print "I win, better luck next time <Player'sName>!"
6. If there are only ties, or an equal number of wins for each, the computer shall print "We tie! That was fun, You are a worthy adversary. Let's play again sometime <Player'sName>"

That is all!
